# What's the deal with the bats? 🦇

I think there's an animal to represent each "side" of my personality. In the case of programming and Internet in general, I frequently stay awake late reading articles, watching videos or simply surfing the web. So yes, it's very easy for me to turn nocturnal like a bat.
