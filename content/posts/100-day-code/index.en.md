I had read about this challenge a couple of weeks ago, but I had just started a new job as a QC Analyst, so I decided I would check it out later... And I did today.

I'm not coding at all at work at the moment, and I really don't want to lose my practice (as insignificant as it might be). So this will be a great day to keep coding and probably even getting new skills and knowledge in the process!

## The plan

Since I want to learn something that could be useful in my career, I'll be coding in **Python** and **JavaScript**. I really like those two languages and I'd also love to learn Testing Automation with either of them in the future.

### Use a main public repo to post code everyday üåû

[This](https://github.com/Dracoptera/100daysOfCode) will be my repo. To be honest, I'm very inexperienced with branching so this will be a great way to change that!

I'll create a new branch for each project I plan on doing.

I really don't use Twitter, but I'll also [Tweet](https://twitter.com/dracoptera) about it everyday, since it's one of the only two rules in the challenge so what the hell!

### Use Trello to organize and keep track of my progress üåõ

Just today too, I created a Trello board for my own personal goals and projects. I also added random stuff I want to do, such as reading a particular book or even cleaning my house.

I'm using [this](https://trello.com/templates/productivity/getting-things-done---gtd-Ui72QWNI) template and it looks promising so far!

### Use the Visual Studio Code extension to help me out üåö

So actually the way I found out about this challenge was through [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-100-days-of-code#:~:text=The%20100%20Days%20of%20Code%20is%20a%20coding%20challenge%20created,day%20for%20100%20consecutive%20days.) extension.

It looked pretty cool but I had no idea what it was for (I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory but still).

I've just installed and it looks pretty cool and useful! It's counted 30 minutes on writing this, so let's say today counts. üòÜ

### Pick up different projects üåú

I doubt I'll finish all these projects in just 100 days, but this is what I have planned so far:

1. **Impractical Python Projects** üêç
   This is a whole book but it has some pretty interesting things I'd like to try out. Specifically, the _Breeding Giant Rats with Genetic Algorithms_ project.

   I've read that this book can feel very heavy on maths. But that also makes it interested for this challenge (I've been running away from maths way too long now).

   You can get the book [here](https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects).

2. **freeCodeCamp Web Design Challenges** ‚òï

I've heard only wonders about freeCodeCamp, and I actually tried it once, but I felt like I already knew all the basics (LOL, yeah sure). However, I checked it out again and I loved it! They also added Python challenges and courses which makes it even more interesting for me.

In this case however, I'll focus on finishing at least a couple of their [Responsive Web Design Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

3. **Python Game of Life** ü¶†

I love biology so this is a perfect challenge for me! I saw this [project](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/) a while ago, last year, actually. It looked awesome but also pretty intimidating, so I never even started.

This will be my chance!

Read more about Conway's Game of Life [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

4. **Anything that looks interesting!** üéÉ

Here's some pretty nice resources I found when I started learning programming. Actually, I got the Game of Life link from one of them.

- [Project based learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning)
- [Awesome DIY Software](https://github.com/cweagans/awesome-diy-software)
- [Build your own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x)
- [Projects from Scratch](https://github.com/AlgoryL/Projects-from-Scratch)

## In conclusion...

Well what can I say? I'm just excited to try this challenge and of course, completing it!
