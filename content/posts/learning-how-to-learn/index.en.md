I recently finished the course [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) in Coursera. As part of the final assignment, it's necessary to create any type of content reviewing the materials learned and how it will affect your studies from now on.

{{< admonition note "Note" >}}
First of all I'd like to clarify I'm not a native English speaker. I took this course in its original language because, if I can, I always prefer the original language for courses, movies, books, etc. So please forgive me if there's any grammar or spelling errors.

## Introduction

As you might have guessed by now, the course is about learning more efficiently. It's also one of the [most popular courses](https://www.coursera.org/collections/popular-online-courses-coursera-anniversary) in Coursera at the time I'm writing this.

I found it by mere coincidence and decided to try it, since I do feel like I barely learn sometimes, even after hours of watching videos or reading documentation.

Keep reading to find out if it's actually worth it... Or just scroll down to the bottom!

One of the great things about this course, is that from the very beginning you know it will be **scientifically based**. Unfortunately, the Internet is filled with pseudo-science based content. Even libraries are full of mumbo-jumbo books to learn, lose weight, become a millionaire... It sells, and it's easy to convince people since these contents usually sound _too good_ (too good to be true I'd say).

The course is based on the book [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039916524X), written by the main instructor, Barbara Oakley. Her voice is clear and smooth, and you can tell she really knows what she's talking about.

## Some key concepts

First of all let me introduce these key concepts real quick, so you understand the foundation of the course's tips and methods.

### Focused and Diffuse Thinking

We're all familiar with **Focused Thinking**. When we're trying to learn a new subject, what we tend to do is spend minutes to hours completely immersed in books, lectures and videos about it.

That's alright. In fact, focused thinking is really important in learning. But it's just part of it.

There's also **Diffuse Thinking**, which is done unconsciously and in a broader perspective. It's when you let your mind _be free_. Like when you take a long journey and think about nothing in the bus. You're actually thinking, but not focusing on anything in particular.

When you do this, you make random connections inside your brain without even noticing it. These connections will later help you understand concepts much better.

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
Do you feel stuck after hours of Focused Thinking study sessions? _Take a break!_ Go out, take a walk and try to let your thoughts flow.

**Exercise** will also benefit your learning process, and let you think in a diffused way. Not to mention it benefits your general well being.

If it's already late, **sleep** instead. You will get rid of toxins in your brain by doing so, and learn much better the next day.

### Chunking

**Chunking** is a pshychological term that refers to the process of creating **chunks** in your brain: pieces of information needed to understand new concepts. These chunks are usually bound together by meaning.

Neurologically speaking, a chunk is a bunch of neurons that fire at the same time when you think about a subject that you've already learned.

In order to learn, you will **need** to create new chunks, which will eventually create even bigger ones and let you master the subject.

### Procrastination

We're all familiar with this infamous term: **procrastination**. But why is it so easy to fall for it?

It turns out, procrastination is linked to the **insular cortex** of the brain, which is also linked to pain. So it's not just an expression saying it's a pain to do something you really don't want to do.

Here's what happens when you procrastinate:

1. You get an unhappy feeling and sensation.
2. You funnel your attention to a more pleasant task (such as surfing the web).
3. You feel temporarily happy.

Luckily, even if you feel a sensation related to physical pain when you think about doing something that you don't want to (such as studying!), it's also very easy and quick to get rid of that sensation once you actually start _doing it_.

## How to learn better

{{< figure src="octopus.png" title="The octopus will make key connections in your brain with its arms!" width=40% >}}

So what did I actually learn? What will make me change my habits and become a better learner?

To be honest, I knew almost nothing the course teaches, so I find all this information very valuable and I hope it helps you as well.

### Practice, but do it right

**Practice makes perfect**. We've all heard it and we know it's true. Even if you think you're good at something (and you probably are), if you don't practice then you'll never be _great_ at it.

This is of course also true for learning. I'm learning programming at the moment, in particular, Front-end Web Development. My biggest problem so far is not practicing the right way. I tend to follow tutorials for hours a day and fool myself into thinking I already know what I'm doing (I'll also talk about this false perception later).

**Spaced repetition** is the way to go. Instead of trying to master a topic or skill the same day, you need to practice in a span of days. Maybe just 15 or 30 minutes. The important thing is that you do it consistently. You'll soon notice a difference (I am already!).

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
Do you find it hard to avoid distractions when you try to practice or achieve your daily task?

Try the [**Pomodoro Technique**](https://tomato-timer.com/). A simple 25-minute timer that allows a 5 minute break after finishing a session.

**Rewards** release dopamine, and are an essential part of acquiring new habits, so you'll find it easier to concentrate when you know it's achievable, and you'll even get 5 minutes to read your new messages and notifications!

### Learn how to effectively form new chunks

{{< figure src="brain.png" title="Help your brain" width=40% >}}

Since chunks are an essential part of learning, you need to understand how to create them in the most efficient way.

1. **Focus** entirely on the subject to chunk.
2. **Understand** the basic idea you're trying to chunk. Gain **context** to know when to and when not to use the chunk.
3. **Practice** to get a better sense of the big picture and gain expertise.

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
If you're like me, you like watching problem-solving tutorials and think: _"Of course, I figured it would be something like that!"_. But did you, actually?

After watching a problem being solved, **try doing it yourself**. Try doing a harder one. Looking into more advanced materials will also help your brain make connections.
{{< /admonition >}}

What's even better about chunks is that they can relate to new knowledge through a process called **transfer**. So, in short, they're always helpful!

### Improve your memory

{{< figure src="cpu.png" title="Not this type..." width=40% >}}

As you might have guessed, memory is very strongly linked to chunking. In particular, **Long Term Memory**, which acts like a _warehouse_ in your brain, storing information and retrieving it when it's needed.

When you access those memories in the warehouse, you also _strengthen_ them.

**Recalling** is an excellent way of improving your learning. Instead of trying to memorize everything by taking notes and re-reading them constantly, try simply reacalling what you've just learned as soon as the chapter or lesson ends. Think about it, and try to recall as much information as possible. This simple technique is much more effective than note reading.

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
When taking notes, **handwriting** seems to be a more effective way for memorization than typing.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
Relate the concept you're trying to learn with a more memorable Acronym or picture. Even if it's crazy or seemingly unrelated.

For instance, I remember learning the color order of the venomous [coral snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake) to avoid confusing it with the faux ones, thanks to a simple but memorable acronym: "Rana", which means frog in spanish. Rojo (red), Amarillo (yellow), Negro (black) and Amarillo again.

### Understand and avoid procrastination

As explained earlier, procrastination makes you feel temporarily better.

You may be thinking it's a harmless habit, but it's actually hard to overcome the longer you do it. It's comparable to **addiction** in the way it affects your life.

{{< figure src="checklists.png" title="Plan ahead" width=40% >}}

To help you overcome procrastination, use a **journal** to plan your next day activities right before going to sleep.

Seeing them listead will actually make it more easy to achieve them, since you're actually checking the list instead of doing each of the tasks (or at least that's what you'll be thinking).

Commiting yourself to this routine will help you succeed in avoiding procrastination.

{{< admonition tip "Tip" >}}
Make sure to give yourself a reward - but only after completing your task.

Also, try doing the least pleasant task **first thing in the morning** (or when you wake up).
{{< /admonition >}}

### Don't fool yourself: the Illusion of Competence

{{< figure src="sawing.png" title="This isn't real!" width=40% >}}

You may already have some very solid chunks in your brain about a particular subject you've practiced and studied enough. You then practice more and think you already know all about it - you may. This is called **overlearning** and can bring the false feeling that you know even harder topics. This is called **Illusion of Competence**.

This is another reason why recalling is much more effective than testing yourself with your notes or re-reading them. You may think you know something, but when you actually try to simply recall it, you'll know if that's actually true.

Instead, also try focusing on more difficult learning. This is called **deliberate practice**.

Similarly, you might want to try teaching somebody else about the topic you're learning.

### Interleave your learning

{{< admonition note "Note" >}}
Interleaving is discussed in the science and math learning field.
{{< /admonition >}}

As mentioned earlier, focusing only on simple chapters or problems will not help you learn.

**Einstellung** is the phenomenom that happens when you focus too much on an easier method to solve a problem, so you never give yourself the chance to find a better solution (because you haven't learnt about them).

With **interleaving**, you'll be able to expand your knowledge and get better solutions. A simple technique is checking the subtitles and picture in the chapter, or even further chapters, so your brain gets a _preview_ of what will be coming next. This helps when you start creating those chunks.

## My plan from now on

{{< figure src="diet.png" title="I will change!" width=40% >}}

I really feel like I learned a lot during this course, and also by making this post (I even created a blog and looked up a new technology just for it!).

From now on, I'll do my best to achieve the following:

1. **Check my task list**. I'm starting with simple tasks to avoid procrastination, setting more realistic achievements.
2. **Go for a walk**. At least evey other day to start with. Exercise is extremely important and I've been avoiding it way too long.
3. **Work on my pending project**. As a side job and hobby, I like making and selling plush toys. I sometimes need to make sure I have them ready before a certain date.
4. **Study**. Practice what I'm learning setting up Pomodoro sessions. Make sure I have a quitting time set, which is also important.
5. Approaching the end of the day, **check again my task list**. Create the tasks for the next day.
6. Think about the topics I'm learning when **going to sleep**. Hopefully I'll dream about it and help my memory!
7. **Help others** by sharing the tips I learned. I want all my friend and family to succeed!

Thank you for reading my assignment. Have an excellent day. :)
